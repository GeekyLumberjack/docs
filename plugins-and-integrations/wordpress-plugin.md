# Wordpress Plugin

Unlock provides a [Wordpress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/unlock-protocol/) which integrates our [Paywall](../applications/paywall/) application into any WordPress.org site. This is the easiest way to lock content inside of pages and posts so that only your members can access them.

We maintain a WordPress.org site which lets you experience the membership experience from a visitor's point of view: [wordpress-demo.unlock-protocol.com](https://wordpress-demo.unlock-protocol.com/).

#### Pre-requisites

1. You have deployed your own Lock [following the instructions on this page](https://docs.unlock-protocol.com/#create-a-lock).
2. You are using wordpress.org to host a WordPress site yourself \(wordpress.com website will not work as plugins are restricted on that platform.\)

### Install the Unlock plugin 

Inside the admin section of your WordPress site, click on Plugins &gt; Add New

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

In the search bar on the plugins page, search for "Unlock Protocol"

![Search for the plugin](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%286%29.png)

![Click on &quot;Install Now&quot;, and then on &quot;Activate&quot;.](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2810%29.png)

Once the plugin has been installed, you need to configure it with your lock address.

![For this, in the Settings Menu, pick Unlock.](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png)

![Enter your lock address. \(See per-requisite to deploy your own lock\)](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

After this, you're all set and you can start locking content on your posts or pages!

### Using the Unlock plugin 

The plugin adds 2 "blocks" to your Gutember Editor. The first block lets you hide/show content based on whether the current visitor owns a key to your lock. This block can include other blocks so you can easily lock images or any other content.

The second block is actually a button to let your visitors purchase an access key to your lock.

#### Showing content to members only \(hiding it for non members\)

Like any other block, click on the âŠ• sign to add an "Unock Protocol Block".

Once added to the page, the block contains a visual indication \(only when editint the post!\) to show the block's status:

From there you can add more content which will only be visible by members.

#### Showing content to non-members only \(hiding it for members\)

On the right column, a setting lets you toggle between members-only and non-members-only content:

#### Showing a button to let visitors become members

The Editor also lets you chose a "Checkout Button" which users can click on to become members!

Once added to the page you can customize its text. The button defaults to the template style.

Make sure you save your post or page once it's been configured!
